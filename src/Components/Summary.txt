1. useState hook lets us add state to functional component
2. In classes, state is always an object
3. With the useState hook, state doesn't have to be an object
--it can be array,boolea,string,etc.
4. If new state depends on previous state,pass a function to setter function
-- the setter function receives previous state as argument
5. When dealing with objects or arrays, always first spread state variable then
call setter function
